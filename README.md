# Mask-Game
A little text-based python game I created to practice subnetting for my CCNA studies (This is also my foray into Git).

The game basically has three modes:
1. Mask (dotted-decimal to slash)
2. Prefix (slash to dotted-decimal)
3. Random

Some additional things I would like to do are:
1. Make use of the curses library to make it look prettier
2. Do a batter job of parsing input (slashes, etc.) and either ignore certain characters or provide helpful info


Have fun.
